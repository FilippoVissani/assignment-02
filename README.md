# assignment-02
The assignment is divided into three points, relating to three different asynchronous programming styles (tasks, events and reactive programming).
## 1- Task Frameworks
Implement a task solution of the problem described in assignment # 01, maintaining the subdivision in the two points:
- Without GUI, to make a comparison at the performance level (doing the same tests carried out in assignment # 01 and making a comparison with those results too).
- With GUI.

Adopting an approach based on Java Executors, making use, on the one hand, of design principles and methods useful to favor modularity, encapsulation and relative properties, on the other, a solution that maximizes performance and responsiveness.
## 2- Event-Driven Asynchronous Programming
JavaParser is an open-source library that provides functionality for parsing and analyzing Java source code, building the AST and allowing you to navigate the tree with the Visitor pattern. The library works at the single file level.
We want to create a library with asynchronous API (based on event-loop) that allows to provide a minimal set of analysis functionalities of a Java project, being able to exploit JavaParser in its implementation.
Given the library, build a simple GUI application that allows you to:
- Select the project folder.
- Start the analysis and possibly interrupt it, in a responsive way.
- View the found elements gradually, in an appropriate form.
## 3- Reactive Programming
Realize a solution to the problem described in point 2 based on reactive programming.
